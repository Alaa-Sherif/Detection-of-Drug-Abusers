SVM ==> OVO "it scale poorly with the size of the training set, so it faster to train many classifiers on small training set that training few classifiers on large training set
i


train an OVA ( and dont forget to tune the parameters to handle the bias)
train an OVO ( it doesn't require bias handling cuz its trained on just the class that it classifies)
